Term Project: Quoridor Game Implementation
Project Overview
In this project, you will develop a complete implementation of the abstract strategy board game
Quoridor. This project will test your ability to implement game mechanics, develop a graphical
user interface, create AI opponents of varying difficulty, and document your work professionally.
Game Description: Quoridor
Quoridor is a strategy board game that was invented by Mirko Marchesi and first released in
1997. The game has won several awards including the Mensa Mind Game award.
Game Rules
1. Game Board: The game is played on a 9×9 square board.
2. Players: 2-4 players can play, but you'll implement the 2-player version.
3. Game Pieces:
o Each player has a pawn that begins at the center of their respective base line
o Each player has 10 walls (5 walls in a 4-player game)
4. Objective: Be the first player to move your pawn to any square on the opposite side of
the board.
5. Movement:
o On each turn, a player must either move their pawn or place a wall
o Pawns move one square orthogonally (not diagonally)
o Players cannot move through walls or opponent pawns
o If a player's pawn is adjacent to an opponent's pawn, the player can jump over
the opponent's pawn (if there's no wall blocking)
o If a jump is blocked by a wall, the player can move diagonally around the
opponent's pawn
6. Wall Placement:
o Walls are two squares long and are placed on the edges between squares
o Walls cannot overlap or cross other walls
o Walls cannot be placed to completely block a player's path to the goal (there
must always be a valid path to the goal for each player)
o Once placed, walls cannot be moved
Project Requirements
Core Requirements
1. Game Implementation:
o Implement the complete ruleset of Quoridor for 2 players
o Create a graphical user interface (GUI) for the game
o Include game state visualization (board, pawns, walls, whose turn it is)
o Implement valid move highlighting and error prevention for illegal moves
o Include a path-finding algorithm to ensure wall placements don't completely
block a player
2. Game Modes:
o Human vs. Human (local play on the same computer)
o Human vs. Computer (with AI opponent)
3. User Interface:
o Clear visualization of the game board, pawns, and walls
o Intuitive controls for moving pawns and placing walls
o Turn indicator
o Wall count display for each player
o Game state messages (whose turn, invalid moves, winner announcement)
o Game reset functionality
4. Documentation:
o GitHub repository with complete source code
o README file with:
▪ Game description
▪ Screenshots of the game in action
▪ Installation and running instructions
▪ Controls explanation
▪ Link to demo video
o Project report (PDF) including:
▪ Design decisions and architecture
▪ Implementation challenges and solutions
▪ AI algorithm explanation
▪ Assumptions made during development
▪ References and resources used
5. Demo Video:
o 3-5 minute video demonstrating:
▪ Game setup and UI overview
▪ Human vs. Human gameplay
▪ Human vs. Computer gameplay
Bonus Features (for additional marks)
1. AI Difficulty Levels:
o Implement multiple AI difficulty levels (e.g., Easy, Medium, Hard)
o Document the algorithms used for each difficulty level
2. Additional Features “Adds +10% of the total project total” (choose one to
implement):
o Game state saving/loading
o Undo/redo functionality
o 4-player mode
o Custom board sizes
Technical Requirements
1. Programming Language:
o You may use any programming language and framework that supports GUI
development
o Popular choices include Python (with Pygame, Tkinter, or PyQt), Java (with JavaFX
or Swing), JavaScript (with HTML5 Canvas for Web), or C++ (with SFML or Qt)
2. Version Control:
o Create a public GitHub repository for your project
o Make regular, meaningful commits showing your development process
o Include a .gitignore file appropriate for your language/framework
3. Code Quality:
o Well-organized, readable code with appropriate comments
o Separation of concerns (game logic, UI, AI)
o Avoid code duplication and use appropriate design patterns
Deliverables and Deadline
1. GitHub Repository Link:
o Submit the URL to your public GitHub repository
o The repository must include all source code, assets, and documentation
2. Project Report:
o Submit a PDF report (6-10 pages) covering the topics outlined above
o Include the link to your demo video in the report
3. Demo Video:
o Upload to YouTube, Google Drive, or any similar platform
o Include the link in both your report and README.md
